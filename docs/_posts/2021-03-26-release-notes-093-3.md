With this release, while it is quite small I was finally able to fix the longstanding problem with fast typing and cursor jumping randomly inside of the TextEdit component. In the end, as usual in our profession, the fix was really easy ðŸ˜… But the road to it was long and painful.

Anyways the new version is up and running so please update your projects.
